Thank you for buying my first book!

My name is Leo. I'm a 4 year old lurcher pup. This book is all about what it means when dogs like me get the barks and how you can help us to feel better.

This book should be seen as resource to help you out with your pup. This should be seen as a replacement for individual advice from a well trained professional.

I take 0 liability for anything that happens to you from reading this book. If you are concerned about any of the suggestions in this book then feel free to discuss them first with your veterinary specialist.
